 Challenges Encountered
 • Synchronization issues: Camera and GAITRite data were not hardware-synced,
 limiting temporal alignment.
 • Sparse dataset: Only 7 usable footsteps with valid CoP, requiring synthetic data
 augmentation.
 • Pose noise: MediaPipe outputs may jitter under occlusion or poor lighting, espe
cially for foot joints.
 • Registration complexity: Required accurate spatial transformation between
 image-space and physical CoP space.
