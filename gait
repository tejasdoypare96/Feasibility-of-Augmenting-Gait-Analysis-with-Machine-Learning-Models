Human gait—the manner or style of walking—is a rich source of information about a
person’s neuromuscular health. Quantitative gait analysis is used clinically to assess
conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, post-stroke recovery, cerebral palsy, and age-
related fall risks. A critical parameter in such assessments is the Center of Pressure
(CoP), which captures the point of application of the resultant ground reaction force
during stance phases.
Traditional gait analysis systems such as GAITRite offer sub-centimeter CoP res-
olution using pressure-sensitive walkways. However, they are expensive, non-portable,
and require specialized installation. In contrast, consumer-grade RGB cameras and pose
estimation tools like MediaPipe have democratized access to high-quality 3D human
joint data. This convergence raises an important research question:
Can we accurately predict biomechanical parameters like CoP using only af-
fordable, non-intrusive visual sensors and machine learning?
